    "summary": "The chart displays electricity demand forecasts from 2020 to 2025, with each year represented by a different colored line. The x-axis represents the months from January (1) to December (12), and the y-axis shows the electricity demand in megawatts (MW), ranging from 65,000 MW to 100,000 MW.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **2024 (Red Line):** \n  - Peaks at 97,115 MW in August.\n  - Lowest demand is 69,899 MW in May.\n  - Shows a significant increase from May to August.\n\n- **2023 (Blue Line):**\n  - Peaks at 93,700 MW in August.\n  - Lowest demand is 72,272 MW in May.\n  - Follows a similar trend to 2024 but with lower values.\n\n- **2025 (Orange Line):**\n  - Peaks at 95,300 MW in January.\n  - Shows a decline to 89,231 MW in February.\n  - The trend is not fully visible but starts high.\n\n- **2022 (Pink Line):**\n  - Peaks at 92,990 MW in August.\n  - Lowest demand is 71,881 MW in April.\n\n- **2021 (Black Line):**\n  - Peaks at 89,091 MW in August.\n  - Lowest demand is 66,699 MW in April.\n\n- **2020 (Green Line):**\n  - Peaks at 86,555 MW in August.\n  - Lowest demand is 68,454 MW in November.\n\n### Trends:\n\n- **Seasonal Peaks:** All years show a peak in demand during the summer months (July-August), likely due to increased cooling needs.\n- **Lowest Demand:** Typically occurs in the spring (April-May) and late fall (November), indicating lower energy consumption during these periods.\n- **Yearly Increase:** There is a general upward trend in peak demand from 2020 to 2024, indicating growing electricity needs over the years.\n\nThis chart provides a clear visualization of the seasonal and annual variations in electricity demand, highlighting the increasing trend over the years."
