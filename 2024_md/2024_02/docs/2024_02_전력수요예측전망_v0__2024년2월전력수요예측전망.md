The chart indicates that there is a 40% probability of experiencing either adequate or similar occurrences of abnormal low temperatures compared to the average of 3 days, with a 20% probability of many occurrences.

### Abnormal High Temperatures (이상고온):
- **Adequate (적음):** 20%
- **Similar (비슷):** 40%
- **Many (많음):** 40%

For abnormal high temperatures, there is a 20% probability of adequate occurrences, while the probabilities for similar and many occurrences are both 40%.

### Summary:
Both charts show a balanced probability distribution for similar occurrences (40%) in both low and high temperatures. However, there is a higher probability of many occurrences for high temperatures (40%) compared to low temperatures (20%).
