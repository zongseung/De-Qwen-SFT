The image appears to be a legend or key for interpreting a figure related to electricity demand forecasts for November 2024. It includes two main sections:

1. **평년범위 (Average Range):**
   - **평균기온 (Average Temperature):** 
     - The legend shows a box plot with a line indicating the average value for a reference period. The terms "상한" (upper limit) and "하한" (lower limit) suggest the range of temperatures.
     - Color indicators: 
       - "낮음" (Low) in dark blue
       - "비슷" (Similar) in gray
       - "높음" (High) in red

2. **강수량 (Precipitation):**
   - Similar box plot representation with a line indicating the median value for precipitation.
   - Color indicators:
     - "적음" (Low) in orange
     - "비슷" (Similar) in gray
     - "많음" (High) in teal

These elements are likely used to interpret data on temperature and precipitation trends, which can influence electricity demand forecasts. The colors and box plots help visualize deviations from average conditions.
