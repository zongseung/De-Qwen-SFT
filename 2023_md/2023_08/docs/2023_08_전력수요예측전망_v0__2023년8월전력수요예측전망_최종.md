The figure presents a regional forecast of electricity demand across South Korea for August, September, and October. The map is divided into different regions, each showing three bars representing different temperature ranges: normal (blue), high (gray), and very high (red).

### August:
- Most regions show a higher proportion of very high temperatures (red bars), indicating increased electricity demand.
- Seoul, Gyeonggi-do, and Gangwon-do have significant red bars, suggesting a high demand.

### September:
- The trend shifts slightly with a decrease in very high temperatures.
- Regions like Gyeongsangbuk-do and Jeollanam-do still show notable red bars, but less than in August.

### October:
- A further decrease in very high temperatures is observed.
- Most regions show a balance between normal and high temperatures, with fewer very high temperature predictions.

### Table Summary:
- **Nationwide Average Temperature Range (°C):**
  - August: 24.6 - 25.6
  - September: 20.2 - 20.8
  - October: 13.9 - 14.7

- **Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi-do:**
  - August: 24.9 - 25.9
  - September: 20.5 - 21.1
  - October: 13.6 - 14.6

- **Gangwon-do (East):**
  - August: 23.7 - 24.2
  - September: 18.1 - 18.9
  - October: 11.7 - 12.3

The data indicates a general trend of decreasing temperatures from August to October, which correlates with a decrease in electricity demand as the need for cooling diminishes.

The figure consists of two bar charts, each representing the occurrence of abnormal temperatures.

### Left Chart: 이상저온 발생일수 (Abnormal Low Temperature Occurrence Days)
- **50%**: 적음 (Low)
- **40%**: 비슷 (Similar)
- **10%**: 많음 (High)

### Right Chart: 이상고온 발생일수 (Abnormal High Temperature Occurrence Days)
- **20%**: 적음 (Low)
- **40%**: 비슷 (Similar)
- **40%**: 많음 (High)

### Analysis
- For abnormal low temperatures, the majority of occurrences are low (50%), with a significant portion being similar (40%), and a small percentage being high (10%).
- For abnormal high temperatures, occurrences are evenly split between similar (40%) and high (40%), with a smaller portion being low (20%).

This suggests a higher likelihood of experiencing abnormal high temperatures compared to low temperatures.

The image appears to be a gauge or scale with two sections: a blue section labeled "이상저온" and a red section labeled "이상고온." 

- The blue section ("이상저온") indicates a range from 0 to 10, suggesting a lower temperature scenario.
- The red section ("이상고온") also ranges from 0 to 10, indicating a higher temperature scenario.

The text under the blue section mentions "평년 최고기온 30미만" which translates to "average maximum temperature below 30." This suggests that the blue section represents scenarios where temperatures are below the average maximum of 30 degrees.

The text under the red section states "평년 최고기온 30이상" meaning "average maximum temperature 30 or above." This indicates that the red section represents scenarios where temperatures are above the average maximum of 30 degrees.

In the context of electricity demand forecasting, this scale might be used to assess how temperature variations could impact electricity consumption, with higher temperatures potentially leading to increased demand due to cooling needs.
