The figure consists of two bar charts, each representing the occurrence rates of abnormal conditions and high temperatures.

### Left Chart: Abnormal Conditions Occurrence Rate
- **40%**: The probability of conditions being similar to or slightly different from the average (3 days).
- **40%**: The probability of conditions being moderately different.
- **20%**: The probability of conditions being significantly different.

### Right Chart: High Temperature Occurrence Rate
- **10%**: The probability of temperatures being slightly higher than the average (3 days).
- **40%**: The probability of temperatures being moderately higher.
- **50%**: The probability of temperatures being significantly higher.

### Trends
- For abnormal conditions, there is an equal likelihood (40%) of conditions being similar or moderately different from the average, with a lower chance (20%) of significant deviation.
- For high temperatures, there is a higher likelihood (50%) of significant increases compared to the average, with moderate increases also being common (40%).

The context suggests a focus on predicting deviations from average conditions and temperatures, with a notable emphasis on the likelihood of significant temperature increases.
