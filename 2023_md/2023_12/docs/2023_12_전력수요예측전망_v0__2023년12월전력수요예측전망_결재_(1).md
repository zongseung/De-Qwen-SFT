The chart illustrates the distribution of "이상저온 발생일수" (abnormal low-temperature occurrence days) in percentage terms. It is divided into three categories:

1. **적음 (Low)**: Represented by the light green color, this category accounts for 40% of the occurrence days.
2. **비슷 (Similar)**: Shown in light blue, this also constitutes 40% of the days.
3. **많음 (High)**: Indicated by the dark blue color, this category makes up 20% of the occurrence days.

The chart suggests that the majority of the days fall into the "Low" and "Similar" categories, each with 40%, while a smaller portion, 20%, is categorized as "High." This distribution provides insight into the expected frequency of abnormal low-temperature days.

The chart illustrates the distribution of "이상고온 발생일수" (days of abnormal high temperatures) in three categories: 적음 (few), 보통 (normal), and 많음 (many).

- **20%** of the days fall into the "적음" (few) category, represented by the light yellow color.
- **40%** of the days are categorized as "보통" (normal), shown in orange.
- Another **40%** of the days are in the "많음" (many) category, depicted in red.

The chart indicates that a significant portion of the days, 80% in total, experience either normal or many occurrences of high temperatures, with an equal split between these two categories. Only a smaller portion, 20%, falls into the few category.
