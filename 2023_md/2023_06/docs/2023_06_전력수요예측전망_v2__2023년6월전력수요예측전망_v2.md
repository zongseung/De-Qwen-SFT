The image appears to be a gauge or scale related to temperature, with two sections labeled in Korean. 

- The left side is labeled "이상저온" (abnormally low temperature) in blue, with a scale from 0 to 10.
- The right side is labeled "이상고온" (abnormally high temperature) in red, with a scale from 90 to 100.

The text below the blue section indicates "평년 최고기온 10퍼센타일 미만" (below the 10th percentile of average maximum temperature), while the text below the red section indicates "평년 최고기온 90퍼센타일 초과" (above the 90th percentile of average maximum temperature).

This scale likely represents a range of temperature anomalies, with the blue section indicating cooler than average conditions and the red section indicating warmer than average conditions. The context suggests this is part of an electricity demand forecast, where temperature extremes can significantly impact electricity usage.
