The image appears to be a gauge or scale with two sections labeled in Korean. On the left, the blue section is labeled "이상저온" (below normal temperature), and on the right, the red section is labeled "이상고온" (above normal temperature). 

The scale seems to measure temperature deviations, with the blue section indicating temperatures below a certain threshold and the red section indicating temperatures above it. The numbers "10" and "90" are likely percentile markers, suggesting that the scale measures temperature percentiles, with "10" indicating the lower 10th percentile and "90" indicating the upper 90th percentile.

In the context of electricity demand forecasting, this scale might be used to assess how temperature deviations from the norm could impact electricity consumption, with colder or hotter than normal temperatures potentially leading to increased demand for heating or cooling, respectively.
