The image appears to be a gauge or scale with two sections, labeled in Korean. On the left side, the blue section is labeled "이상저온" (abnormally low temperature), and on the right side, the red section is labeled "이상고온" (abnormally high temperature).

- The blue section indicates temperatures below the 10th percentile.
- The red section indicates temperatures above the 90th percentile.

This scale is likely used to categorize temperature anomalies, with the context suggesting a focus on electricity demand forecasting for September 2023. Abnormally low or high temperatures can significantly impact electricity demand, as heating or cooling needs increase.
