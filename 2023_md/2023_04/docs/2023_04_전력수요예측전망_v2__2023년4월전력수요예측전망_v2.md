The figure consists of two bar charts, each representing the occurrence probability of abnormal temperatures.

### Left Chart: Abnormally Low Temperatures
- **50%**: Represents the probability of temperatures being much lower than average.
- **40%**: Represents the probability of temperatures being moderately lower than average.
- **10%**: Represents the probability of temperatures being slightly lower than average.

The text below indicates that the probability of having lower temperatures than the average (3 days) is 50%.

### Right Chart: Abnormally High Temperatures
- **10%**: Represents the probability of temperatures being slightly higher than average.
- **40%**: Represents the probability of temperatures being moderately higher than average.
- **50%**: Represents the probability of temperatures being much higher than average.

The text below indicates that the probability of having higher temperatures than the average (3 days) is 50%.

### Summary
- Both charts show a 50% probability for the most extreme temperature deviations (either much lower or much higher).
- Moderate deviations have a 40% probability in both cases.
- Slight deviations have a 10% probability in both cases.
