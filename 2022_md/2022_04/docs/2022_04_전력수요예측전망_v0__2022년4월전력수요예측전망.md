The figure consists of two bar charts, each representing the occurrence probability of abnormal temperatures.

### Left Chart: 이상저온 (Abnormal Low Temperature)
- **20%**: 적음 (Low)
- **50%**: 비슷 (Similar)
- **30%**: 많음 (High)

The text below indicates that the probability of having similar conditions to the average (3 days) is 50%.

### Right Chart: 이상고온 (Abnormal High Temperature)
- **20%**: 적음 (Low)
- **40%**: 비슷 (Similar)
- **40%**: 많음 (High)

The text below states that the probability of having conditions similar to or higher than the average (3 days) is 40% each.

### Summary
- For abnormal low temperatures, there is a higher probability (50%) of conditions being similar to the average.
- For abnormal high temperatures, there is an equal probability (40%) of conditions being similar to or higher than the average.

The image appears to be a scale or gauge with two sections, labeled in Korean. 

- The left section is blue and labeled "이상저온" (abnormally low temperature), with an arrow pointing left. It indicates temperatures below the average maximum temperature for April.
- The right section is red and labeled "이상고온" (abnormally high temperature), with an arrow pointing right. It indicates temperatures above the average maximum temperature for April.

The scale seems to measure deviations from the average maximum temperature for April, with the midpoint likely representing the average. The numerical value "0" is at the center, suggesting no deviation, while the scale extends in both directions to indicate deviations from this average.
