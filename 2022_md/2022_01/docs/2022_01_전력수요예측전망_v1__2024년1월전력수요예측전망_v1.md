- **Axes and Values:**
  - The chart shows three probability levels: 20%, 30%, and 50%.
  - The colors represent different likelihoods: light green (적음, 20%), blue (비슷, 30%), and dark blue (많음, 50%).
- **Trend:**
  - There is a 50% probability that the occurrence of abnormal low temperatures will be similar to the average (3 days).
  - The likelihood of having fewer days is 20%, while the likelihood of having more days is 30%.

### Right Chart: 이상고온 (Abnormal High Temperature)
- **Axes and Values:**
  - The chart also shows three probability levels: 20%, 30%, and 50%.
  - The colors represent different likelihoods: light yellow (적음, 20%), orange (비슷, 30%), and red (많음, 50%).
- **Trend:**
  - There is a 50% probability that the occurrence of abnormal high temperatures will be more than the average (3 days).
  - The likelihood of having fewer days is 20%, while the likelihood of having a similar number of days is 30%.

### Summary
- Both charts indicate a 50% probability for the most significant category: similar occurrence for low temperatures and more occurrence for high temperatures.

The image appears to be a temperature scale related to electricity demand forecasting for January 2024. It is divided into two sections:

1. **Left Section (Blue) - "이상저온" (Abnormally Low Temperature):**
   - The scale indicates temperatures below the 10th percentile.
   - This suggests that if temperatures fall into this range, they are considered significantly lower than usual.

2. **Right Section (Red) - "이상고온" (Abnormally High Temperature):**
   - The scale indicates temperatures above the 90th percentile.
   - This suggests that if temperatures fall into this range, they are considered significantly higher than usual.

The scale is likely used to assess how temperature extremes might impact electricity demand, with colder or hotter than normal temperatures potentially leading to increased demand for heating or cooling, respectively.
