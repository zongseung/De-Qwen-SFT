- **30%**: Probability of temperatures being similar to the average (적음).
- **50%**: Probability of temperatures being slightly below average (비슷).
- **20%**: Probability of temperatures being significantly below average (많음).

The text below indicates that the probability of temperatures being similar to the average over three days is 50%.

### Abnormal High Temperatures (이상고온)
- **20%**: Probability of temperatures being similar to the average (적음).
- **40%**: Probability of temperatures being slightly above average (비슷).
- **40%**: Probability of temperatures being significantly above average (많음).

The text below states that the probability of temperatures being similar to or above the average over three days is 40% each.

### Summary
- For low temperatures, there is a higher likelihood (50%) of experiencing slightly below-average temperatures.
- For high temperatures, there is an equal probability (40%) of experiencing slightly or significantly above-average temperatures.

The image appears to be a gauge or scale with two sections, labeled in Korean. 

- The left section is blue and labeled "이상저온" (abnormally low temperature), with an arrow pointing left and the number 10. This suggests that temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius are considered abnormally low.

- The right section is red and labeled "이상고온" (abnormally high temperature), with an arrow pointing right and the number 20. This indicates that temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius are considered abnormally high.

The context likely involves temperature forecasts or thresholds related to electricity demand, where deviations from normal temperature ranges can impact energy consumption.
