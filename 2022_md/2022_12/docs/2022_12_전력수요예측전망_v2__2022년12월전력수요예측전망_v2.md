<summary>figure 요약 (2022년12월전력수요예측전망_v2_p5_id63)</summary>

The figure shows electricity demand forecasts for December and January across different regions in South Korea. Each region is represented with a bar chart indicating three values: 40, 40, and 20 for December, and 30, 50, and 20 for January. These values likely represent different categories or scenarios of electricity demand.

### December:
- **All regions**: The bars show values of 40, 40, and 20.
- This suggests a consistent forecast across all regions for December.

### January:
- **All regions**: The bars show values of 30, 50, and 20.
- This indicates a shift in the forecast compared to December, with an increase in one category (from 40 to 50) and a decrease in another (from 40 to 30).

### Regional Consistency:
- The forecast is uniform across all regions for both months, indicating a broad, nationwide trend rather than regional variations.

### Interpretation:
- The consistent values across regions suggest a standardized approach to forecasting or a uniform expectation of electricity demand changes from December to January.
- The increase in one category from December to January might indicate a higher expected demand or a different scenario being prioritized.

This analysis provides a clear view of the expected electricity demand trends across South Korea for the specified months.

The figure consists of two bar charts, each representing the occurrence probability of abnormal temperatures.

### Left Chart: 이상저온 (Abnormal Low Temperature)
- **20%**: The probability of having fewer occurrences than average.
- **40%**: The probability of having occurrences similar to the average.
- **40%**: The probability of having more occurrences than average.

The text below indicates that the probability of having occurrences similar to or more than the average (3 days) is 40%.

### Right Chart: 이상고온 (Abnormal High Temperature)
- **30%**: The probability of having fewer occurrences than average.
- **50%**: The probability of having occurrences similar to the average.
- **20%**: The probability of having more occurrences than average.

The text below indicates that the probability of having occurrences similar to the average (3 days) is 50%.

### Summary
- For abnormal low temperatures, there is an equal probability (40%) of having occurrences similar to or more than the average.
- For abnormal high temperatures, there is a higher probability (50%) of having occurrences similar to the average, with fewer occurrences being more likely than more occurrences.
