The chart consists of two sections, each representing the occurrence probability of abnormal temperatures.

### Left Chart: 이상저온 (Abnormally Low Temperatures)
- **Axes and Values:**
  - The chart shows three categories: 적음 (Low), 비슷 (Similar), and 많음 (High).
  - The probabilities are 40% for both 적음 (Low) and 비슷 (Similar), and 20% for 많음 (High).

- **Trend:**
  - There is an equal probability (40%) of experiencing temperatures that are either low or similar to the average.
  - The probability of experiencing high temperatures is lower at 20%.

### Right Chart: 이상고온 (Abnormally High Temperatures)
- **Axes and Values:**
  - The chart shows three categories: 적음 (Low), 비슷 (Similar), and 많음 (High).
  - The probabilities are 20% for 적음 (Low), 30% for 비슷 (Similar), and 50% for 많음 (High).

- **Trend:**
  - There is a higher probability (50%) of experiencing abnormally high temperatures compared to the average.
  - The probability of experiencing similar temperatures is 30%, while the probability of low temperatures is 20%.

### Contextual Summary:
- For abnormally low temperatures, there is a balanced chance of experiencing low or similar temperatures, with a lower chance of high temperatures.
- For abnormally high temperatures, there is a significant likelihood of experiencing higher temperatures than average, with a moderate chance of similar temperatures and a lower chance of low temperatures.

The image appears to be a color-coded scale related to temperature. Here's a detailed interpretation:

- **Left Side (Blue):** 
  - Labeled as "이상저온" (Abnormally Low Temperature).
  - The scale indicates temperatures below the highest maximum temperature of 10°C.

- **Right Side (Red):**
  - Labeled as "이상고온" (Abnormally High Temperature).
  - The scale indicates temperatures above the highest maximum temperature of 30°C.

This scale likely represents a range of temperatures, with the blue side indicating cooler than normal conditions and the red side indicating hotter than normal conditions. The context suggests this is part of an electricity demand forecast, where temperature extremes can significantly impact energy consumption.
