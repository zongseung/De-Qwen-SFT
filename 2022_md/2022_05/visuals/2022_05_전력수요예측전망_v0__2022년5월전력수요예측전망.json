    "summary": "The chart displays electricity demand forecasts from 2018 to 2022, measured in megawatts (MW) on the y-axis, ranging from 60,000 MW to 95,000 MW. The x-axis represents the months from January (1) to December (12).\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- **2022 Forecast (Red Line):**\n  - Starts at 89,391 MW in January.\n  - Peaks at 90,564 MW in February.\n  - Declines to a low of 71,879 MW in May.\n  - Rises again to 86,083 MW by December.\n\n- **Comparative Trends:**\n  - **2018 (Black Line):** Peaks at 92,478 MW in July, the highest among all years.\n  - **2019 (Green Line):** Shows a peak of 91,141 MW in July.\n  - **2020 (Pink Line):** Peaks at 89,091 MW in July.\n  - **2021 (Blue Line):** Peaks at 91,548 MW in July, with a notable dip to 71,070 MW in October.\n\n### General Trends:\n- All years show a similar pattern of high demand in the winter months (January-February) and summer months (July-August), with lower demand in spring (April-May) and fall (October-November).\n- The 2022 forecast shows a slightly lower peak compared to previous years, indicating a potential decrease in maximum demand.\n\nThis analysis provides insights into seasonal electricity demand fluctuations and highlights the expected demand for 2022 in comparison to previous years."
