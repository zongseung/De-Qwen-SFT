<summary>chart 요약 (2022년5월전력수요예측전망_p6_id68)</summary>

The chart illustrates the occurrence probabilities of two different events: "이상저온" (abnormally low temperatures) and "이상고온" (abnormally high temperatures).

### 이상저온 (Abnormally Low Temperatures)
- **20%**: Low occurrence probability.
- **50%**: Moderate occurrence probability.
- **30%**: High occurrence probability.
- The text indicates that the probability of occurrence similar to the average (3 days) is 50%.

### 이상고온 (Abnormally High Temperatures)
- **20%**: Low occurrence probability.
- **40%**: Moderate occurrence probability.
- **40%**: High occurrence probability.
- The text states that the probability of occurrence similar to or higher than the average (3 days) is 40%.

### Color Coding
- **이상저온**: Light green (low), light blue (moderate), dark blue (high).
- **이상고온**: Light yellow (low), orange (moderate), red (high).

The chart suggests that for both temperature extremes, there is a significant probability of moderate to high occurrences, with "이상고온" having a slightly higher probability of high occurrences compared to "이상저온."

The image appears to be a gauge or scale with two sections, labeled in Korean. 

- The left section is in blue, labeled "이상치원" (below normal), with a value of 10. The text below indicates "피크-최고기온 10미만" which translates to "Peak - Maximum temperature below 10."

- The right section is in red, labeled "이상고온" (above normal), with a value of 30. The text below indicates "피크-최고기온 30이상" which translates to "Peak - Maximum temperature above 30."

This scale seems to represent a range of temperature conditions, with the blue section indicating cooler conditions and the red section indicating hotter conditions. The context suggests that this is related to electricity demand forecasting for May 2022, where temperature extremes could impact electricity usage.
