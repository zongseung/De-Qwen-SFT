The image appears to be a color-coded scale related to temperature, with two main sections:

1. **이상저온 (Abnormally Low Temperature)**: 
   - Represented in blue.
   - The scale indicates temperatures where the maximum temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius.

2. **이상고온 (Abnormally High Temperature)**:
   - Represented in red.
   - The scale indicates temperatures where the maximum temperature exceeds 90 degrees Celsius.

The context suggests that this scale is used to categorize temperature extremes, likely for analyzing electricity demand in relation to temperature variations. The focus is on identifying periods of abnormally low or high temperatures, which can significantly impact electricity consumption patterns.
