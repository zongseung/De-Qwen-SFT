    "summary": "The table presents electricity demand forecasts for October from 2018 to 2022, focusing on two key metrics: maximum load (최대부하) and average load (평균부하), both measured in megawatts (MW). The table also shows the year-on-year growth rate in percentage.\n\n### Maximum Load (최대부하)\n- **2018.10월**: 70,329 MW with a growth rate of +0.3%\n- **2019.10월**: 73,550 MW with a growth rate of +4.6%\n- **2020.10월**: 68,454 MW with a growth rate of -6.9%\n- **2021.10월**: 75,698 MW with a growth rate of +10.6%\n- **2022.10월**: 75,400 MW with a growth rate of -0.4%\n\n### Average Load (평균부하)\n- **2018.10월**: 59,587 MW with a growth rate of -1.6%\n- **2019.10월**: 58,363 MW with a growth rate of +1.5%\n- **2020.10월**: 56,627 MW with a growth rate of -0.4%\n- **2021.10월**: 59,775 MW with a growth rate of +1.3%\n- **2022.10월**: 61,800 MW with a growth rate of +3.1%\n\n### Trends\n- **Maximum Load**: There was a significant increase in 2021 (+10.6%) after a decrease in 2020 (-6.9%). However, in 2022, the maximum load slightly decreased by 0.4%.\n- **Average Load**: The average load showed a consistent increase from 2020 to 2022, with the highest growth rate in 2022 (+3.1%).\n\nOverall, the data indicates fluctuations in maximum load, while the average load shows a more stable upward trend in recent years."
